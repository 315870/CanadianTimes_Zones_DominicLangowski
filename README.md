# CanadianTimes_Zones_DominicLangowski
There is another problem I have experienced unfortunately. This is with the Canadian Time Zones as you figured. So I tried to find a solution when the time zones would go into the negatives. I thought that taking the negative integer and adding it to 2400 would work. It did... for the Pacific Time Zone (Victoria, BC), so I tried it with the Mountain time but it didn't work. The number was not showing up. I tried to see what would happen if I commented the Pacific Time Zone and the mountain time showed up. I believe it has something to do with If, else if still relating to the same Pacific Time. I'm not sure though.... Any Ideas?
